# Note Taker Application

## Description

This application is designed to help you track all of the "to-dos" and "to-remember" of your days, by allowing you to create unique notes that can be saved for later. Each note has a entry block for a title and the note content and the notes can be saved. Once you've completed the task or no longer need the reminder, the note can be deleted.

This is a fully deployed application that uses [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/) to serve out the webpage.
